Version 1.0 ✅
- Playable Map for all career modes
- Three markets, all resources, working economy
- Alot of open building space
- Optimized resource placement
- Reworked the roads to better fit buildings.
- Finished (not perfectly polished) the second village, approximately 80% done.
- Textured all the roads and some detailing, around 75% done.
- Implemented random set dressing around the world, about 30% done.
- Completed detailed placement that makes sense in each quarter while leaving ample building space in the city (Woodcutter Area, Guard/Arsenal Execution Area, Big church plaza, poor people quarter, market square). Not sure if it's too open, but prefer more space to build when playing, around 90% done, just needs some tweaking.
